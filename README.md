Step-1: I created the react app usign create-react-app command
step-2: I created 3 components which are NavBar.jsx, user.jsx, userList.jsx
note:-(NavBar is a component which contains all the elements of the navigation bar, User is a component which contains inforamtion of each user and UserList is the componet which renders all the user's data to the screen after recieving it from the api )
step-3: I created the App.js file which makes the api call and send the information to the userList component via props.
